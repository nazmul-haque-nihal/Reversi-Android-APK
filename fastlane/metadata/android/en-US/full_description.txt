2. Making a Move - On your turn, place one of your discs on any empty cell that:
   - Is adjacent to one or more of your opponent's discs
   - Forms a line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) between your new disc and another of your existing discs

4. Valid Moves - The game automatically highlights all valid move positions:
   - Neon Cyan circles show where Black can place a piece
   - Neon Orange circles show where White can place a piece
   - Tap on any highlighted cell to make your move

5. Passing - If you have no valid moves, your turn is automatically passed to your opponent
